#### Errors
If there is a problem obtaining the user-specific data then the `user` object will be replaced with a `userError` object. Other fields (feature flags and shuttering) will be unaffected and still returned:
```
  "shuttering": {
      "shuttered": false
  },
  "enabled": true,
  // etc... other feature flags omitted for brevity
  "userError": { "code": "GENERAL" }
  // no "user" object
}
```

If there is a problem obtaining the account data then the `user.account` object will be replaced with a `user.accountError` object. Other fields will be unaffected and still returned:
```
  "shuttering": {
      "shuttered": false
  },
  "enabled": true,
  // etc... other feature flags omitted for brevity
  "user": {
    "state": "Enrolled"
    "accountError": { "code": "GENERAL" }
    // no "account" object
  }
}
```

#### Shuttering
When the Help to Save section of the app is shuttered then `shuttering.shuttered` will be true and other fields except for feature flags will be omitted:
```
{
  "shuttering": {
    "shuttered": true,
    "title": "Service Unavailable",
    "message": "You’ll be able to use the Help to Save service at 9am on Monday 29 May 2017."
  },
  // Feature toggle for Help to Save app functionality:
  "enabled": true,
  // Fine grained feature toggles
