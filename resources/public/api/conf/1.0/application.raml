  # We implement our own shuttering instead of using the API platform shuttering (<confluence>/display/DTRG/How+to+emergency+shutter+an+API)
  # because:
  # 1) The response returned when API platform shuttering is used (503 with code: "SERVER_ERROR") is difficult to distinguish from the response when certain errors occur.
  # 2) API platform shuttering does not support custom error messages
  #
  # Note that api-documentation-frontend doesn't display anything for this
  # trait, probably because it goes outside API platform norms (errors are
  # usually specified using types.errorResponse, like in ninoInvalid above,
  # but we have more fields in this error response than there are in the API
  # platform standard error response so we can't use types.errorResponse).

      # we'd rather use 503 instead of 521 but can't use 503 because the API platform nginx discards any bodies in 503 responses returned by microservices - see NGC-3396
